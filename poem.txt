La Luna
You left my side, 
but you never completely left me. 
I could still watch you from afar. 
So I did. 
When I watch you I feel at peace,
La luna stay with me.
I know youâ€™re looking too,
La luna stay with me.
With wistful eyes, I looked at you.
No matter how far,
La luna is near.
During your life you were my light in the darkness. And you still are now.
La luna was the only fitting role for you.
Another night with my luna. Surrounded by twinkling wishes. Another night with you.
La luna stay with me, 
la luna be with me.
la luna ..please show me that you care
